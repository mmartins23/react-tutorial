# React Tutorial - Code Evolution YouTube Playlist ðŸŽ¥

Iâ€™ve completed the **React Tutorial** playlist by **Code Evolution**, where I gained a comprehensive understanding of React fundamentals, including creating components, managing state, handling events, routing, and optimizing performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings:

- **Components & JSX**: Learned how to create React components and structure UI using JSX.
- **State Management**: Mastered how to manage component state using `useState` and update it efficiently.
- **Props**: Understood how to pass data between components with props, allowing for dynamic rendering.
- **Event Handling**: Handled events in React components, from clicks to form submissions.
- **React Router**: Implemented navigation and routing within a React application using React Router.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Used conditionals to render different components or elements based on state or props.
- **useEffect**: Managed side effects such as data fetching, timers, and subscriptions using `useEffect`.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Applied best practices to optimize React applications for speed and efficiency.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects:

- Built interactive and dynamic applications such as a **To-Do list** and a **simple blog** to practice React concepts.
- Implemented React Router for page navigation and state management for dynamic UI updates.
