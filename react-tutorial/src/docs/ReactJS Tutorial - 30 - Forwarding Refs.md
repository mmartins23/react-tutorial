### ReactJS Tutorial - Forwarding Refs

#### Summary:
Ref forwarding is a feature in React that allows refs to be passed from parent components to child components. This is useful when a parent component needs direct access to a DOM element in a child component. React achieves this using the `forwardRef` API.

When using `forwardRef`, you can create components that can accept refs from their parent components, allowing direct access to internal DOM elements.

#### Code Example:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, forwardRef } from 'react';

// Child component that forwards its ref to an input element
const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <input ref={ref} type="text" placeholder="Enter text here..." />;
});

const App = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  // Function to focus on the CustomInput element using the forwarded ref
  const focusOnInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* CustomInput accepts the ref from parent */}
      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} />
      
      {/* Button to focus on the CustomInput element */}
      <button onClick={focusOnInput}>Focus on Input</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Using `forwardRef`**: The `CustomInput` component is wrapped with `forwardRef`, which allows it to forward the ref it receives to the internal input element.
2. **Accessing DOM in Parent**: In the `App` component, a `useRef` hook is used to create the `inputRef`, which is passed to the `CustomInput` component as its `ref`. The `inputRef.current` will point directly to the `<input>` DOM element within `CustomInput`.
3. **Focusing the Input**: The `focusOnInput` function triggers the `inputRef.current.focus()` method, which focuses on the input element inside the `CustomInput` component. The button allows the user to interact with the input field directly, even though the input is encapsulated within a child component.

#### When to Use Forwarding Refs:
- When a parent component needs access to a DOM element inside a child component.
- When building reusable components (like input fields) that allow their parent components to manage focus or other DOM operations directly.

#### Practical Use Cases:
- **Custom Form Components**: In custom input components where the parent needs to manage focus or validation.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Integrating components with external libraries that require direct access to DOM elements.

This concept helps in enhancing component reusability while maintaining access to internal elements, giving more control to parent components.
